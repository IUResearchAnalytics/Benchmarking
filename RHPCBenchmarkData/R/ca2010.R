#' An undirected weighted graph matrix stored as a sparse matrix object
#'
#' An undirected weighted graph matrix from the DIMACS10 matrix group of the
#' University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection.
#' Notes from the Sparse Matrix Collection web site on this matrix:
#' The xx2010a graphs are generated from U.S. Census 2010 and Tiger/Line 
#' 2010 shapefiles. They are freely available from census.gov web site.  
#' The xx prefix in the filenames are the U.S. Postal Service acronyms of
#' the state names, e.g.  ny is New York.                                
#'                                                                      
#' * the vertices are the Census Blocks;                                 
#' * two vertices have an edge if and only if the corresponding Census   
#'   Blocks share a line segment on their border, i.e. rook-style      
#'   neighboring.                                                      
#' * each vertex has two weights:                                        
#'   (1) Census2010 POP100 or the number of people living in that       
#'   Census Block, and.                                             
#'   (2) Land Area of the Census Block in square meters                 
#' * the edge weights are the pseudo-length of the shared borderlines.   
#'   The pseudo-length is calculated using sqrt(x^2 + y^2), x and y    
#'   being the differences in longitudes and latitudes of each line    
#'   segment on the shared borderlines.  Then the result is multiplied 
#'   by 10^7 to make the edge weights integers.                        
#' * each Census Block gets identified by a point, and the XY coordinates
#'   are the longitudes and latitudes of each point.  The points are   
#'   selected by Census to be internal to the Census Blocks, but the   
#'   tech doc says that they are not always internal (but always very  
#'   close).
