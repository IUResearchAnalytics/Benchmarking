Description: This package provides microbenchmarks for determining the run time
  performance of aspects of the R programming environment and packages
  commonly used for high-performance computation.  The benchmark currently
  measures the performance of dense linear algebra kernels from the base
  package and sparse linear algebra kernels from the matrix package.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.1)
