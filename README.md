# RBenchmarking
Directories and files descriptions:

 RHPCBenchmark - This is the R HPC benchmark package directory containing
  source code and vignette.  The package directory does not contain
  autogenerated directories and files needed for a complete R package.  To
  generate manual page documentation and perform checks on the package use the
  update_benchmark_package.R script.  To generate the package use,
  generate_benchmark_package.R
 
 RHPCBenchmarkData - This is the companion data package to the R HPC benchmark
  package.  It contains the sparse matrices used by the sparse matrix benchmark
  function in the R HPC benchmark package.  To generate manual page
  documentation and perform checks on the package use the update_data_package.R
  script.  To generate the package, use generate_benchmark_package.R

 dense_matrix_driver.R - This script runs the dense matrix microbenchmarks.

 sparse_matrix_driver.R - This script runs the sparse matrix microbenchmarks.

 machine_learning_driver.R - This script runs the machine learning
  microbenchmarks.

 test_dense_matrix.R - Helpful for testing the dense matrix benchmark on the
  IUAnyware Microsoft Windows R environment.

 test_sparse_matrix.R - Helpful for testing the sparse matrix benchmark on the
  IUAnyware Microsoft Windows R environment.

 test_machine_learning.R - Helpful for testing the machine learning benchmark on
  the IUAnyware Microsoft Windows R environment.

 update_benchmark_package.R - Builds the manual page documentation for all R
  objects in the benchmark package and performs validation checks.

 generate_benchmark_package.R - Builds the benchmark package

 update_vignettes.R - This script builds and installs the vignettes as part
  of a full package install.  Installaing the package is the only way to view
  the vignettes for proofreading for some reason.


Package validation and build process

 To build the R HPC benchmark package:
   1. Run the update_benchmark package.R script
   2. Fix any validation WARNINGs and ERRORs reported in the standard output
      and log file
   3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until problems are resolved
   4. Run the generate_benchmark_package.R script
   5. Run the following on the built package for further validation:
      R CMD check --as-cran [gzipped tar file package]
   6. Fix any validation WARNINGs and ERRORs reported in the standard output and
      log file
   7. Repeat process from step 1 until no WARNINGs or ERRORs are detected

A similar process applies to checking and building the companion R HPC data
package.
